Medical Appointment No Show
People book appointments in medical facilities and institutions for healthcare. Sometimes they do not show up for the appointment scheduled by them. This number is not insignificant and so it is required to analyze this. This project uses dataset built from records of a medical facility and includes fine techniques of machine learning to predict if an individual who books an appointment, will show up or not.
In this work we study dataset of a medical facility and understand the behavior of different factors and their importance in determining whether a person will show up for an appointment he/she booked or not.

The dataset is pre-processed successfully as well as processed and worked upon to predict a class using Decision Tree Classifier with accuracy of 79.80 %.
